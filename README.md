# Casting-Defect-Detection
I have build a CNN model to detect casting defects. I have build my model on top of VGG-16 to maximise the efficiency and improve accuracy. VGG-16 model is designed to work optimally with image size of 224 x 224 pixels. So I have preprocessed my image dataset (which I have downloaded from Kaggle) to 224 x 224 pixels.
Due to resource constraints, I have trained my model with epoch 20 (not the optimal epoch which lead to underfitting), so I got lower accuracy than I expected.
